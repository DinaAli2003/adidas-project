# üëü Project README: Retail Sales & Profit Performance Dashboard

---

### 1. Project Title: **Global Sales & Profit Dynamics Analyzer (Retail Focus)** üöÄ

### 2. Overview üí°

This project features a comprehensive **Sales and Profit Dashboard** built on a robust visualization platform (likely Power BI) to analyze the performance of a major retail brand (as suggested by the "Adidas" project name). The solution is designed to provide immediate, actionable insights across all critical sales dimensions, including **channel, product, retailer, geographic location,** and **time**. It serves as a vital tool for sales managers, marketing teams, and executives to monitor performance against goals and identify key growth opportunities.

### 3. Key Objectives üéØ

The dashboard is structured to address the following strategic business questions:

* **Performance Tracking:** üí∞ Monitor overall **Total Sales, Total Profit,** and **Total Units Sold** against targets.
* **Channel Optimization:** üõçÔ∏è Analyze sales and profit contribution by **Sales Method** (In-Store, Outlet, Online) and by individual **Retailer.**
* **Geographic Strategy:** üó∫Ô∏è Identify the **Top 10 Most Profitable Cities** and analyze sales/profit contribution by **Region** and **State.**
* **Product Strategy:** üëü Determine the **most profitable products** (e.g., Men's Street Footwear) to inform inventory and marketing focus.
* **Temporal Analysis:** üìÖ Track sales performance by **Quarter, Day Type** (Weekday/Weekend), and **over time** to identify seasonality and trends.

### 4. Dashboard Breakdown & Key Insights üìä

The solution comprises two main dashboards for detailed analysis:

#### Dashboard 1: Core Performance & Product Focus üìà

This view provides an overview of aggregate performance and product-level profitability.

| **Total Sales by Sales Method** | Donut chart showing the proportional sales contribution of Online, In-Store, and Outlet channels. |
| **Total Sales by Day type** | Breakdown of sales volume between Weekday and Weekend traffic. |

#### Dashboard 2: Retailer & Geographic Focus üåç

This view breaks down performance by key partners and physical locations.

| Visualization | Core Metrics & Insights |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Top 10 Profitable Cities** | Bar chart identifying the highest-value urban markets for sales and investment. |
| **Total Profit for every Retailer** | Bar chart comparing the profit contribution across major partners (e.g., West Gear, Foot Locker, Sports Direct, Amazon, Walmart). |
| **Total Sales & Total Profit by Region** | Clustered column chart comparing sales volume and profit margin across the West, Northeast, South, and Midwest regions. |
| **Actual Profit vs Target Profit** | Gauge chart showing progress towards the set profit goal. |
| **Total Profit by State (Map)** | Geospatial visualization highlighting profit distribution across states/countries. |

### 5. Interactivity and Usage üñ±Ô∏è

The dashboard utilizes robust **Slicer and Filtering** functionality, allowing users to conduct deep, ad-hoc analysis.

* **Slicers (Top Panel):** Use the **Quarter, Region,** and **Product** slicers to dynamically focus all charts and KPIs on a specific business segment.
* **Cross-Filtering:** Clicking on any element (e.g., a specific bar representing **'Amazon'** in the Retailer chart) will instantly filter every other visual on the report to show the sales, profit, and geographic distribution associated only with that retailer.
* **Drill Down:** Interactive maps and city lists allow managers to zoom into specific markets.

**How to Use:**
1.  Open the **"Adidas project"** file in your data visualization software.
2.  Navigate between **'Dashboard 1'** and **'Dashboard 2'** tabs.
3.  Use the **Slicers** at the top to select desired **Quarter, Region,** or **Product** line.
4.  Interact with the charts to analyze performance trends, pinpoint high-value areas, and inform strategic decisions.
